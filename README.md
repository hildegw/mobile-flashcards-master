# Mobile Flashcards Project
Mobile Flashcards is an app that allows you to write question and answer cards for topics you are studying. You can mark each card as answered correctly or incorrectly to get a percentage score.
The project was implemented by me (hildegw) as part of Udacity Nanodegree. It showcases the use of React-Native, and is a mandatory requirement to pass Udacity React nanondegree.


## Installing and running the project
Download the zip-file from github and unpack. Go to directory where application was unpacked.
* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the application with `yarn run ios` from application directory


## Limitations
* The app has only been tested on iOS simulator using EXPO and Xcode.
Currently, cards cannot be deleted. To facilitate demoing the app, start data contains two decks.
